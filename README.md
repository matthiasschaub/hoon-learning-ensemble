# Hoon Learning Ensemble

Hoon is a strictly typed functional programming language.

Hoon is designed to implement Urbit.

Urbit is a clean-slate OS, network and single pure function.


## Required Preparation

Install Urbit binary by following the steps of chapter two of [this document](https://urbit.org/getting-started/cli)

Optionally: Watch the first 5 minutes of ["Welcome to Urbit"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1qroWiZF90) (Already 7 years old but still on point)

### Reading

- [Why is Hoon the way it is?](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/hoon/overview#why-is-hoon-the-way-it-is): "We are often asked why Urbit was written in a new language, rather than some existing language like Haskell or C. This document provides the high-level rationale for that decision, and also covers some of the features of the language that set it apart from others."
- [Why Hoon?](https://urbit.org/blog/why-hoon): "The promise of Urbit lies in its reimagination of the digital world using components that are as constrained and limited as possible."
